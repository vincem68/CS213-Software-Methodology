This project was a partner based project that focused on more aspects of software development with Java. It's an application designed to add students of a university 
and keep track of their information such as if they're a resident or not, what state they're from, if they're part time or full time, etc. The application uses this
information to calculate each student's tuition based on given rules. This project uses software development skills in Java such as object oriented programming, 
polymorphism, and inheritance.
